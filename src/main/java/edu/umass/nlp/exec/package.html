 To use Execution framework, in the <code>main</code> of you entry point, the
 first line should be
 <br>
 <code>
 edu.umass.nlp.exec.Execution.init(pathToConfigFile);
 </code>
 The <code>pathToConfigFile</code> should be a string to a
 yaml file that stores global options. Global options are used to populate
 objects with public mutable fields using reflection. The purpose of this
 is to provide easy (but not secure or robust) option management.  

 The Execution framework does many thing, here's a summmary

 <h1>Global Option Configuration</h1>

 Options are grouped together in a hierarchichal fashion. For instance, the
 main Execution option would be given in yaml by
 
  <pre>
  <code> 
   exec:
   &nbsp;execPoolDir: execs
   &nbsp;loggerPattern: %-5p [%c]: %m%n
  </code>
  </pre>
  
  So in your code when you call:
  <pre>
  <code>
    Execution.Opts execOpts = <a href="Execution.html#fillOptions">Execution.fillOptions</a>("exec", new Execution.Opts());
  </code>                                                                        
  </pre>
  
  We reflectively look up options under the <code>exec</code> part of the configuration
  file and fills in fields of the passed in objects. You can fill in different instances
  of the same options object by using different group names (e.g. <code>exec1, exec2, ...</code>).   

  You can also do hierarchical option filling. 

  <h1>Store Execution Log and Options in a Directory</h1>

  Another feature of the Execution framework is that the log of every run goes to a directory
  specified in the <code>exec.execDir</code> directory. Typically, you shouldn't specify the 
  directory and instead use the option <code>exec.execPoolDir</code> which will automatically
  make a new directory for each execution run by adding <code>0.exec,1.exec,2.exec,...</code>
  as needed. The directory will store everything sent to the logger as well as a copy of configuration
  needed to re-run the experiment (modulo code changes obviously). 

  If you want to store other output in the execution directory, you have access to it in
  <code><a href="Execution.html#getExecutionDirectory">Execution.getExecutionDirectry</a></code>.

  You can add option processing behavior using
  <code><a href="Execution.html#addOptionHandler">Execution.addOptionHandler</a></code>. See
  <code><a href="StandardOptionHandlers.html"></a>StandardOptionHandlers</code> for example
  option handlers. 
            
  <h1>Apache Logger Configuration</h1>

  The Execution framework also configures the log4j logger (the pattern
  for the logger prefix is configurable via the <code>exec.loggerPattern</code> option
  in your global config file. 

  This means in your code you should probably not use <code>System.out.println</code> and
  opt instead to use the logger. You can read about the Apache Logger system <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/manual.html">here</a>.  

  Two relevant configurable options are:  <code><a href="Execution.Opts.html#loggerPattern">Execution.Opts.loggerPattern</a></code>
  and <code><a href="Execution.Opts.html#logLevel">Execution.Opts.logLevel</a></code>.
